# **App Name**: CodeSage

## Core Features:

- Real-time Code Analysis: Continuously track code as it’s written and safely run it in a sandboxed environment. Detect syntax and runtime errors instantly and measure execution time and memory usage.
- Complexity Analysis Tool: Estimate algorithmic complexity (Big O) in real-time as the candidate types their code.
- Agentic Interviewer with Hint System: The AI interviewer adapts problem difficulty and offers hints progressively (Nudge → Guide → Direction) using reasoning to determine when and how to incorporate those pieces of information.
- Code Quality Assessment: Assess style, readability, and adherence to standards (e.g., PEP 8), and recommend alternative solutions or optimizations.
- Comprehensive Reporting System: Present candidate metrics in a visual dashboard and generate a human-readable summary of the candidate’s performance and problem-solving journey. Provide a session playback feature.
- Interactive Code Editor: An intuitive, interactive UI that allows candidates to code and receive hints.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust, intelligence, and stability, which are important for a tool assessing code.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#F5F6FA) to provide a clean and professional backdrop that is easy on the eyes during long coding sessions.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF9800) for interactive elements and hints, drawing attention and providing clear visual cues.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use clean and minimalistic icons to represent actions, feedback, and coding concepts.
- Subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback and guide the user through the interview process.
